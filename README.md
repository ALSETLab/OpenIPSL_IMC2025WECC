Models used in the paper "Expanding an Open-Source Modelica-Compliant Package of Generic Renewable Energy Source Models: Implementation of the REEC_D and REGC_B WECC Models in OpenIPSL" by S. Bhattacharjee, F. Fachini, and L. Vanfretti for the 16th International Modelica & FMI Conference 2025.
## General Information

This repository contains the models used in the paper "Expanding an Open-Source Modelica-Compliant Package of Generic Renewable Energy Source Models: Implementation of the REEC_D and REGC_B WECC Models in OpenIPSL" by S. Bhattacharjee, F. Fachini, and L. Vanfretti submitted to the 16th International Modelica & FMI Conference 2025.

The models were developed and tested with **Dymola 2024X** under MS Windows 11.
